# Psychic-Game

How my game works:

Each round, you have 10 guesses to find out which letter the computer is thinking of.
If you run out of guesses, the computer wins that round.  If you guess the correct letter in a round before 10 guesses are up, you win that round.  When you win 5 rounds, you win the game.  When the computer wins 5 rounds, you lose the game.
